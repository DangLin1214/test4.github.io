### UKB Dataset
The UKB dataset provides comprehensive data on health, lifestyle, and demographic variables. We used several key variables to investigate our research questions:

`Age`: Participants' age, categorized into 10-year age groups (30-39, 40-49, etc.) <br>
`Sex`: Male or female <br>
`Alcohol Consumption`: Grouped into categories (non-drinker, low, medium, high, very high) <br>
`Blood Pressure (BP)`: Continuous variable categorized into intervals (e.g., BP=20, 40, 60, etc.) <br>
`Income Levels`: Seven income brackets, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 7 (highest) <br>
`Diet Quality`: Scored from 0 (poorest) to 7 (highest) <br>
`Sleep Hours`: Nightly sleep duration, measured in hours <br>

<br>

### Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the data was cleaned and processed using RStudio to ensure accuracy and usability:

- Missing values were handled appropriately.
- Continuous variables were transformed and categorized.
- Derived variables, such as quartiles for inflammatory indices, were created for group analysis.
- Outliers were identified and removed to avoid skewing results.

The final cleaned dataset contained observations across all key variables, ready for exploratory analysis and visualization.
